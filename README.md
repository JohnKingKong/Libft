The first project done at 42 Qu√©bec.

It consist of a DIY homemade library, with a ton of useful and basics functions for future reference.

This repo will more than likely be updated while I'm completing my cursus, as it is my own standard library.

As for the project, all mandatory and bonus functions are included, for a grand total grade of 125/100!

Enjoy, take as much as you want, but be sure to understand what you use!

Big love
