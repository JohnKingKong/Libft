# 42-Libft

Personnal standard library, made for the first 42 prroject, filled to the brim with useful functions.

## Description

At 42, we aren't allowed to use basic functions, without implementing it first, which mean the first project is to build a library from scratch, full of functions that copies the behavior of already implemented functions, plus a few more designed from scratch. This library contains functions as simple as strlen or putchar, or as complicated as ft_split, or ft_itoa. The mandatory, aswell as the bonus functions have been done, for a grand total of 125/100.
This library will more than likely be updated as I'm going through my cursus, as I'll be allowed to implement it in future projects.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* No real dependencies, apart common and standard libraries (ex: stdef.h, string.h, ctype.h, etc)

### Installing

* Clone the repo wherever you want the library to be.

### Executing program

* There is a Makefile, whick rules like all, clean, fclean, bonus and re. the bonus rule allows you to compile the bonus functions aswell as the mandatory ones. The Makefile is instructed to compile with GCC appending -Wall, -Werror and -Wextra as flags.

* You can get rid of the ".o" afterwards, using make clean, or fclean, to get rid of the libft.a aswell.

## Help

* If any problem is encountered during the compiling, be aware these functions were written and used on a Mac. which can influence the compiling. I know some functions doesn't complie in Windows environment, but I'm pretty sure Linux can handle all of em just fine.
